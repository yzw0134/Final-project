## Description
Giving a simple bank system brings many functions about different sort of things. This bank system provides a good view on account name, amount of money, own digital number, and safe code.
## Functions
### several functions:
1.Asking data function. Contains void enter account name, void enter the money put into account, void enter the safe code. Void enter password. Those functions will contains verify function:
If {
// if it is a valid name or not(except number, wrong index, symbol, capitalize or not)
}
If{
	// enter the correct number or not
}
2.Void set money This function is sorting the bank account as amount of money the user have put in. Sort by(0-5000,5000-15000,15000 above) different account will have different interests.
3.	int random safe code. This function will send user a 4 digital code each time. This code will save to the system and each time will check if it is much. 
4.	Void set password. Give user a chance to change password and ask for safe code to change password.
5.  String display all the information you have for the account. 

## Scenario
People login into the web page of the bank. First they would like to check for their balance. Then they might check what they spend and earn. After that they may make some transfer or spending in the account, sometimes they may issue some payment.

## Does
if it is toward one user systme, won't need to do array object to sort all users. Data for user will include balance,password,name,type,safe questions, spend and earn.

## Thinks
"Should this bank system only create for one user?"
"Should display page in a table or just terminal normal display?"
"Should this system include interest rate and others sort of things"
"Should I use switch method to do the front page?"

## Says
It might take a while for collection all the data and cause problem while user have to enter one by one.
Might need to include different benefit system to the bank.
Might need to compare difference between different balance account.

## Feels
User might found out the bank system is convenient and useful and they decided to use.
